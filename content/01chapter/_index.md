## Provisioning the Azure environment (40min)

{{% notice warning %}}

Provisioning can take several minutes.  Delivery to corporate email addresses can be delayed, so we recommend using a personal email address (gmail works great) to speed up delivery. If you do not receive an email after 10 minutes, please check your spam folder and/or notify the instructors

\*\*\* __PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT MULTIPLE TIMES__ \*\*\*

There is no notice here of submission, your email address just disappears.

Provision your Azure Environment, enter your Email address and click **Provision**

When provisioning is complete, one of the following will happen.

* You will receive an email with Azure environment credentials. Use those credentials for this environment, even if you have your own.
* You will receive an email indicating that there are no environments available to utilize. In this case please try again at a later date.
* You will receive an email indicating that the supplied email address is from an unsupported domain.
* No email received due to an unexpected error. You can try again or notify the Azure CSE team.

Tasks

* Setup Azure Cloud Shell
* Run Terraform
