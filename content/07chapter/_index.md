Bot mitigation is a key part of protecting your applications from automated threats. FortiAppSec Cloud offers several security modules, including machine learning, to help identify and stop bot traffic. By analyzing both application and user behavior, you can fine-tune these bot detection modules to better protect against malicious activity. This approach keeps legitimate users moving through your apps without disruption, while still blocking bad actors.

In the next steps, weâ€™ll configure the available bot mitigation modules and then test them by sending bot-like traffic using the provided script.
