**Bot Deception :** Configuring the bot deception policy involves embedding links in HTML-type response pages. These links are invisible to regular clients but detectable by malicious bots like web crawlers. When bots request the resources pointed to by these invisible links, it allows Fortiweb to identify the request as originating from an automated source.
