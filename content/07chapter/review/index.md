### Review

In this module, we performed a simple bot attack to demonstrate the capabilities of the FortiAppSec solution.  
FortiAppSec Cloud also offers additional bot mitigation features powered by machine learning, which we will cover in a later chapter.

The provided **bots** tool includes many options for delivering different types of bot attacks.  
You can run additional simulations to see how FortiAppSec Cloud can detect and mitigate these attacks.
