**Threshold based detection:** FortiWeb allows configuring threshold-based detection rules to specify the occurrence, time period, severity, and trigger policy for various suspicious behaviors. This includes:

1. Crawler Detection: Identifying excessive crawling behavior that may indicate bot activity attempting to index or scrape website content.
  
2. Vulnerability Scanning: Monitoring for patterns indicative of automated scans searching for vulnerabilities in web applications or infrastructure.
  
3. Slow Attack Detection: Identifying slow-rate attacks where requests are deliberately slowed to evade detection or overwhelm servers.
  
4. Content Scraping Detection: Detecting patterns consistent with automated scraping of website content for unauthorized use or distribution.
  
5. Illegal User Scan Detection: Identifying scanning activities aimed at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system.

By configuring these rules, FortiWeb can assess whether requests originate from humans or bots, helping to mitigate potential threats effective
