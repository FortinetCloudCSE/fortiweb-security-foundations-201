### Welcome!

In this lab, you will have an opportunity to configure FortiAppSec Cloud to protect a Juice Shop server, emulating a very vulnerable e-commerce website.  Students will onboard their application and then run a few simple attacks, as well as turn on several security features, in order to learn more about FortiAppSec Cloud's capabilities.

### FortiAppSec
FortiAppSec is Fortinet's Web Application and API security platform, enabling enterprise customers to protect web applications no matter where they are deployed.  FortiAppSec defends web applications and APIs against OWASP Top-10 threats, DDOS attacks, and malicious bot attacks. Advanced ML-powered features improve security and reduce administrative overhead. Capabilities include anomaly detection, API discovery/protection, bot mitigation and advanced threat analytics to identify the most critical threats across all protected applications.

FortiAppSec Cloud WAF as a Service (WAFaaS) reduces administrative overhead by offering the full suite of FortiAppSec security features without the need to manage VMs and networking.  Customers simply change their DNS records so that all appication traffic is proxied through FortiAppSec Cloud.


### Learning Objectives
- Learn to Onboard Web Applications into FortiAppSec Cloud
- Explore SQL injection attacks and then block them with FortiAppSec Cloud 
- Secure API's with FortiAppSec Cloud
